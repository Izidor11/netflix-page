We've used the create-react-app tool to set up our environment. 


To run the code cd into each individual folder and run the following commands:

npm install 

will install all the libraries you'll need to get each Daily UI running.

npm start

compiles all of your files and boots up a dev server. Browse to localhost:3000 to find your application running.
